# Design Choices for Intelligent Load Balancer

## Overview

The design of this intelligent load balancer emphasizes flexibility, efficiency, and scalability to effectively manage and distribute traffic across multiple API endpoints. Here are some key design choices:

### Dynamic Routing

- **API Type**: Routes requests based on the type of API (REST, GraphQL, gRPC).
- **Randomized Routing**: Utilizes randomized load balancing to evenly distribute traffic among servers.
- **Custom Criteria**: Allows customization of routing logic based on specific application requirements.

### Queue Management

- **Queuing Strategies**: Implements various queue strategies (e.g., FIFO, priority-based, round-robin) to optimize request handling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Balances workload across servers to minimize response times and maximize throughput.

### Logging and Metrics

- **Detailed Logging**: Captures metrics such as request times, endpoint selection, and response times for performance analysis.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides insights into server load and performance to facilitate proactive management.

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Ensures reliability and correctness of routing and queuing mechanisms under different scenarios.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures and analyzes system performance to validate scalability and efficiency.

## Conclusion

The chosen design aims to deliver robust and scalable performance while maintaining flexibility to accommodate diverse application needs and evolving traffic patterns.
